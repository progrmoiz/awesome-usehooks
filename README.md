# 🚀 Awesome React Hooks
A collection of super duper useful hooks for use in React TypeScript projects. You'll be hooked! (See what we did there?)

## 🔌 Installation
No installation is required. Simply copy and paste the hooks you want to use into your project. It's that easy! 🤓

## 🎣 Hooks
- `useLocalStorage`: A hook for using local storage in a React TypeScript application. No more reaching for that pesky window object! 🤯
- `useTheme`: A hook for managing a theme in a React TypeScript application. Finally, an easy way to toggle between light and dark mode! 🌞🌚

## 🤝 Contributing
We welcome contributions to this project! If you have an idea for a hook that you think would be useful to others (or just really cool), please feel free to submit a pull request. We'll review it as soon as we can, but we might be a little too busy using these awesome hooks. 😅
